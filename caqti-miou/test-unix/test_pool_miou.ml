  (* NOTE(dinosaure): For a simple core, the miou pattern is not the most
     optimised: it's basically a scheduler within a scheduler. So the [Switch]
     ends up in the role of a small scheduler which will execute tasks with
     [async], whereas Miou is a scheduler. The aim is for the [Switch] to
     execute tasks in another domain. In this case, the test execution time is
     reasonable, but for a simple core, this repetition of task management slows
     down the process. We therefore limit the number of tasks to be performed
     for a single core.

     We could offer another [Switch] implementation depending on the number of
     domains available. However, this choice can only be made dynamically. It is
     more reasonable to consider that with miou, we have at least 2 cores
     available. *)
