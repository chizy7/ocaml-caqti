(** Establishing Connections for Eio without Unix

    This module provides connections to the PGX database for Eio applications.
    For other database systems, you will need {!Caqti_eio_unix}.

    {b The caqti-eio library should be considered unstable} for now.  Eio is in
    active development including its API, and the Caqti interface to it may
    benefit from further revision before the first major Eio release lands. *)
