(** Registration and Loading of Drivers

    This interface is unstable and may change between minor versions.  If you
    are developing an external driver, please open an issue to sort out
    requirements and to announce you need for a stable driver API. *)

(** This is the signature implemented by drivers, given the system dependencies.
    More precisely, drivers implement either {!DRIVER_FUNCTOR} or
    {!Caqti_platform_unix.Driver_loader.DRIVER_FUNCTOR} depending on
    requirements. *)

  type (+'a, +'err) stream
  type switch
  type stdenv

     and type ('a, 'err) stream := ('a, 'err) stream
