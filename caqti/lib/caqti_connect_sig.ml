      If you use preemptive threading, note that the connection must only be
      used from the thread where it was created.

      See {{!tweaks} Database Tweaks} for details about the [tweaks_version]
      parameter.

      @param tweaks_version
        Declares compatibility with database tweaks introduced up to the given
        version of Caqti.  Defaults to a conservative value.  See the above
        reference for more info (not linked here due to odoc issue).

        variables which occurs in the query templates of the requests executed
        on the connection. *)

      [with_connection] closes the database connection.

  (** [connect_pool uri] is a pool of database connections constructed by

      Do not use pooling for connections to volatile resources like
      [sqlite3::memory:] and beware of temporary tables or other objects which
      may not be shared across connections to the same URI.

      If you use preemptive threading, note that the connection pool must only
      be used from the thread where it was created. Use thread local storage to
      create a separate pool per thread if necessary.

      @param pool_config
        Provides tuning parameters for the pool.  The default is the result of a
        fresh call of {!Caqti_pool_config.default_from_env}.

        Passed to {!connect} when creating new connections.

      @param env
