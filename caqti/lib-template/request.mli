(** Request specification.

    A Caqti request is a function to generate a query string from information
    about the driver, along with type descriptors to encode parameters and
    decode rows returned from the same query.  Requests are passed to
    {!Caqti_connection_sig.S.call} or one of its shortcut methods provided by a
    database connection handle.

    The request often represent a prepared query, in which case it is static and
    can be defined directly in a module scope.  However, an optional [oneshot]
    parameter may be passed to indicate a dynamically generated query. *)

(** {2 Primitive Constructor and Accessors} *)

type ('a, 'b, +'m) t constraint 'm = [< `Zero | `One | `Many]
(** A request specification embedding a query generator, parameter encoder, and
    row decoder.
    - ['a] is the type of the expected parameter bundle.
    - ['b] is the type of a returned row.
    - ['m] is the possible multiplicities of returned rows. *)

val create :
  ?oneshot: bool ->
  'a Row_type.t -> 'b Row_type.t -> 'm Row_mult.t ->
  (Driver_info.t -> Query.t) -> ('a, 'b, 'm) t
(** [create arg_type row_type row_mult f] is a request which takes parameters of
    type [arg_type], returns rows of type [row_type] with multiplicity
    [row_mult], and which sends query strings generated from the query [f di],
    where [di] is the {!Driver_info.t} of the target driver.  The driver is
    responsible for turning parameter references into a form accepted by the
    database, while other differences must be handled by [f].

    @param oneshot
      Disables caching of a prepared statements on connections for this query.

        - If false (the default), the statement is prepared and a handle is
          permanently attached to the connection object right before the first
          time it is executed.

        - If true, everything allocated in order to execute the statement is
          released after use.

      In other words, the default is suitable for queries which are bound to
      static modules.  Conversely, you should pass [~oneshot:true] if the query
      is dynamically generated, whether it is within a function or a dynamic
      module, since there will otherwise be a memory leak associated with
      long-lived connections.  You might as well also pass [~oneshot:true] if
      you know that the query will only executed at most once (or a very few
      times) on each connection. *)

val param_type : ('a, _, _) t -> 'a Row_type.t
(** [param_type req] is the type of parameter bundles expected by [req]. *)

val row_type : (_, 'b, _) t -> 'b Row_type.t
(** [row_type req] is the type of rows returned by [req]. *)

val row_mult : (_, _, 'm) t -> 'm Row_mult.t
(** [row_mult req] indicates how many rows [req] may return.  This is asserted
    when constructing the query. *)

val query_id : ('a, 'b, 'm) t -> int option
(** If [req] is a prepared query, then [query_id req] is [Some id] for some [id]
    which uniquely identifies [req], otherwise it is [None]. *)

val query : ('a, 'b, 'm) t -> Driver_info.t -> Query.t
(** [query req] is the function which generates the query of this request
    possibly tailored for the given driver. *)


(** They are implemented in terms of {!Request.create} and
    {!Query.of_string_exn}, meaning that the query string arguments accepts
    {{!query_template} The Syntax of Query Templates}.

    The [?oneshot] argument defaults to [false], so when not constructing
    one-shot queries, the full application [(pt -->! rt) f] can be written
    [pt -->! rt @@ f], which motivates the {!(@:-)} and {!(@@:-)} shortcuts. *)
